Today we're going to spend most of our time getting setup with all of the tools
we'll be using throughout the semester. While we're going through these various
activities, please check off the different tasks after you've completed them 
and at the end, you'll push your changes to your github repo. 


## SCC and SCC OnDemand

Lecture (15 minutes)
[Computational Skills Primer](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FbAWxSftB0tWXEKVv17yU6luyYoJ4PlQsx8qsz6kDHE/present?usp=sharing)

Activity (5 minutes)

Ensure you can do the following in VSCode:

- [ ] Open a terminal

## git / github

Lecture (15 minutes)
[git / GitHub](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17a8OwDCTyIhzgNgsJkEBWzEu2CPm9x3QKy9ZHR5tyxA/present?usp=sharing)
Activity (25 minutes)

We will walk through it together live but if you're more comfortable following
written instructions, please setup a SSH key by following the directions [here](https://www.bu.edu/tech/support/research/system-usage/connect-scc/access-and-security/using-scc-with-github-2fa/#AUTH)

This SSH key will pair your SCC account and github repo and allow you to perform
basic git operations (push and pull) from the command line without having to 
enter a password every time.

- [ ] Successfully setup a SSH key
- [ ] Accept and clone the github classroom link


## Conda

Lecture (15 minutes)
