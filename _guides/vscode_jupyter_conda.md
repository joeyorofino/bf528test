# Overview

It can be helpful to work directly in VSCode and Jupyter Notebooks when developing
your pipelines. This will enable you to take advantage of both the features of VSCode
and Jupyter Notebooks to make your development process more efficient. 

Just like for our nextflow processes, we will want to carefully define a conda
environment for the analysis we will be performing in our jupyter notebooks. These
analyses being done in your notebook can often be some of the most biologically 
relevant and interesting results. It is critically important that these analyses
are reproducible and transparent.
